# Meheresh Yeditha's Personal Website

## Hello!

Hi there! Not much to see here that you can't already see at the corresponding Github Pages site!

## Just a Port

Please note that this is just a port of a [previous website](https://mehereshy.github.io)!

## On ES6 usage

In the interest of cross-compatibility, I use *var* in the JavaScript code I wrote rather than *let*. I know ES6, I swear.

## On Harsh Judgments of My Programming Skill Based on Certain JavaScript Code

Do not fret, it will be revised in a future commit!

# The End
